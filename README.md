Just like there are multiple programming languages in the world, in the same way, there are innumerable categories in which they can be classified. A programming paradigm is one such way which tries to classify programming languages based on their features or coding style. A programming paradigm is essentially a style or a way of programming.
Most of the times we understand Python as an object-oriented language, where we model our data in the form of classes, objects, and methods. However, there exist several alternatives to OOP and functional programming is one of them.
